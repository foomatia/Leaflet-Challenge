# Leaflet-Challenge

## Background
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) plays a crucial role in providing scientific data related to natural hazards, ecosystem health, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. As part of their efforts, they collect vast amounts of earthquake data from around the world daily. The challenge at hand is to develop a visualization tool that effectively communicates this data, aiding in public education and collaboration with government organizations.

### Create the Earthquake Visualization
1. I started with getting my dataset.
2. I visited the USGS GeoJSON Feed page which was provided.
3. An appropriate dataset was chosen.
4. The JSON representation of the selected dataset was obtained.
5. I imported the data
6. Using Leaflet, I created a map plotting earthquakes based on their latitude and longitude.
7. I implemented a TileLayer that loads without error to provide a base map.
8. I connected to the GeoJSON API using D3 without encountering issues.
9. The earthquake magnitude were represented with markers, adjusting their size accordingly.
10. The earthquake depth was reflected through marker color, with darker shades indicating greater depth.
11. I included popups for each marker with additional information about the earthquake.
12. A legend to provide context for map data was created, indicating depth levels and corresponding colors.

### Acknowlegdements
Additionally to the provided material for this assignment, I took the help of the offical Leaflet documentation, StackOverflow and the internet to complete this assignment.
